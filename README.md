# specific
Get lower accuracy algorithm vector from given algorithm vector with appending some bits into input.

# Description
Once we get masp optimized copy structures, the result is A in R^4n tan Ax!=0, either orthogonal parts == 0, we reduce the accuracy by applying some of the invariant in reverse order bit.
