# specific
Get lower accuracy algorithm vector from given algorithm vector with appending some bits into input.

# Description
Once we get masp optimized copy structures, the result is A in R^4n tan Ax==0.

We want to isolate them with pre-calculated algorithm table, however, they're to fix the copied structures into some of the structures they doesn't describe theirselves enough.

So we want to exclude some of the complexity shirks into input stream specific handle point value and shrink structure complexity.
They tells us specific handle points the structure have.

# Case division
We can switch the hypothesis case (i) we have both input stream and copied structures (ii) we only have structures.

The (i) case, we can avoid the heavy optimization with input stream orthogonality accuracy checks but this is obscure now.

The (ii) case, we have to do tan (Ax + By) == 0 optimization with y=tan Cx.
They're second or third order optimization when we describe them as a optimization structures.
If they needs third order optimization in any which case, getting another structures {g(b_k)} from {a_k} subset R as simple enough structure is to observe them in randtools meaning also, if the bucket the stream tells is full and they're some multiple path to do such optimization, the collision occures.
