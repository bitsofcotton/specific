# specific
Get lower accuracy algorithm vector from given algorithm vector with appending some bits into input.

# Description
Once we get masp optimized copy structures, the result is A in R^4n tan Ax!=0, either orthogonal parts == 0, we reduce the accuracy by applying some of the invariant in reverse order bit blocks.

We add 4 bit per each command also output added 4bit as a image either don't show the reduced bit number result.

Either we need some debug on this.
